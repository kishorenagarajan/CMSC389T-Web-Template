        Relevant Info
	      Regarding my past experiences, from May 2020 to December 2021, I worked with Evans & Chambers as a Web Development Intern. As my first professional
	      experience, I had the oppurtunity to learn about how project were developed in a team environment, capture customer requirements, and work with AWS'
	      products such as EC2 and S3.
	      
	      In my most recent experience, I interned with Amazon (AWS) as part of the AWS PhysicalAssetService team as a Software Development Intern. The intern 
	      went from June 2022 to August 2022. During my internship, I created an ops tool to speed up ticket resolution times for developers on the team. The 
	      team manages all physical assets that are located within AWS data centers.

        Your Interests
	      Throughout college, I acquired in an interest in economics and picked it up as a second major. Economics felt naturally very interesting to me as
	      there are intricacies to how supply and demand function in different situations. Additionaly, I have a strong interest in the MLB and NFL and
	      taking a look at player data to estimate best future performance.
